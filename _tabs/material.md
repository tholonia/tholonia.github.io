Each of these items in some way contributed to the research that went into the writing of Tholonia. This is only a very small selection, as there are currently 492 reference notes in the book.  It may not be clear why some of this material is relevant, and to be honest, I can't remember myself... for example, the book on eye exercises... no idea what was in there that was useful, but there was something.
