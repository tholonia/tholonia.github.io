# About THOLONIA

## “Energy Is Awareness”

THOLONIA attempts to show how all of existence, from ideas to form, from quarks to galaxies, were created by the same set of rules  that are derived from a single dimensionless point in an infinite nothingness, a point that has only two properties; awareness and intention.  Conceptually, this zero-dimensional point is the source of everything, and as everything is energy, then energy is awareness and intention, and awareness and intention is energy.  In short, all that has, does, or can exist is an expression of awareness and intention.  Tholonia also shows how consciousness, as an instance of awareness, is a property of existence.  This idea opens the door to the idea of an infinite number of life forms and intelligences across an infinite number of realities. 

The word tholonia is derived from three concepts: 

1) The tetrahedron, which is the simplest form that can exist in three dimensional spacetime.

2) The word holon, from the Greek ‘holo’ meaning ‘whole’, refers to an autonomous self-reliant unit composed of parts called partons, which are themselves holons, just as the holon acts as a parton to a yet larger holon. Combining these concepts, we have a self-similar or fractal tetrahedral holon or a tholon.

3) The Latin suffix of "ia" to indicate the plurality of the hierarchical, self-similar, and redundant nature of tholons that describe every aspect of reality.

## WHAT'S THE GOAL?

To approach the phenomenon of energy, awareness, and consciousness rationally and critically to understand their roles in how reality unfolds and discover the true nature of these phenomena. The intention is not to produce new theories, although that may happen. The intention is to create real-world, real-time, practical applications that broaden perspectives beyond the limits of the current scientific paradigm resulting in more effective actions. All materials produced by this project are open-sourced.

## WHAT IS THE THOLONIC MODEL?

**"Energy is Awareness"**

By this, we mean the energy that powers the sun, moves your car, keeps the lights on, holds atoms and galaxies together, etc., is awareness. This is a bold claim, but the tholonic model attempts to show how all of existence, from ideas to form, quarks to galaxies, all dimensions and realities, all concepts, ideas, and beliefs, were created by the same set of rules that are derived from a single non-existent 0-dimensional point of nothing in an infinite nothingness, a point that has only two properties; awareness and intention, out of which form emerges. The tholonic model describes how the foundational structure of all-that-is must adhere to a set of laws that can be described by the first form, the tetrahedron, and its multi-dimensional, fractal, self-replicating forms.

We can clearly see these laws in such things as Newton's 2nd law of motion, the laws of gravity and electricity, relativity, and the quantum wave function, but also in math, mysticism, culture, chaos, free will, fate, evolution, economics, religion, morphic fields, dark matter, telepathy, and more, including the nature of consciousness, intelligence, and properties of reality and existence that go far beyond our current world view.

## THE “PLAN”

- Discover patterns and relationships that can be described with the Tholonic Model.
  ***"Men love to wonder, and that is the seed of science."***, *Ralph Waldo Emerson*

- Describe how the Tholonic Model applies. Update the model. Rinse and repeat.
  ***“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”***, *Leonardo da Vinci*

- Perform tests using the model.
  ***“It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.”***, *Richard P. Feynman*

## On a personal note

I am a 67 year-old retired IT professional currently living in Argentina where I started the THOLONIA project in 2018.  The work and research behind it started in 1962 when I had my first out-of-body experience at age 6.  After 50 years of experiments, study, and research into the less obvious dimensions of reality, the clues and evidence began to coalesce into a semi-coherent form that is THOLONIA and which is intended to compatible with the scientific method could be understood and explained in a rational manner.
