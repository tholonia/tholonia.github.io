In this article, the author discusses the use of magnets to structure water for various applications. They provide case studies from Australia's largest produce farms and industrial solutions provider Pursanova, showing phenomenal results with 25% less water used for a superior product. The author also shares their personal experience with spinning water in a magnetic field to create SW, similar to the animal studies mentioned. However, they note that there is no standardized accepted technique to manually structure water.

The article discusses the mysteries of matter and the universe's ordinary matter. It highlights a surprise graphene discovery that could unlock secrets of super-conductivity, while also mentioning other advancements in the field such as graphene allowing for rapid transformation of light into electrical signals. Additionally, the article touches on the topic of matter's rotation and flipping, suggesting that it is due to the lowest energy state required by mass. The article concludes by stating that 4 is a significant number in this context, as it relates to the binary tree and the tholon structure.

Sure! Here is a summary of the article in 72 words:

The article discusses how DMT, a psychedelic substance, can reach the brain and alter consciousness. It explains that DMT must pass through the blood-brain barrier, which is protected by a chemical called monoamine oxidase (MAO). MAO inhibitors are used in pharmaceuticals to treat depression and Parkinson's disease, and they can help DMT reach the brain without interfering with its effects.

The article discusses the concept of zero and its acceptance by various animals, including bees, monkeys, crows, and others. It highlights how the understanding and adoption of zero have gone through different stages, just like the well-known 5 stages of grief. The article also touches upon the idea that humans have been using numerical symbols for centuries, but it is interesting to see how other animals can comprehend and utilize this concept as well.

In this article, Jim McGovern discusses the connection between space-time, shape, and symmetry in relation to thermodynamics. He highlights how the concept of colors was introduced to explain the interaction between fundamental forces in a similar manner to how primary colors interact. The article also mentions the basis for quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which uses colors to explain how the three fundamental forces interact, and how this idea was met with skepticism when first introduced.

The article discusses the concept of holarchy, a hierarchical structure with multiple levels of creation, each with its own unique properties. The author argues that it is the properties of movement and energy that are consistent across all levels of creation, despite the presence of different types of elements within the hierarchy.

The article discusses the concept of "mechanical effect," which refers to the influence of animal or vegetable life on matter. Lord Kelvin describes this influence as infinitely beyond the range of scientific inquiry, while a child prodigy in recorded history, William, has a unique perspective on living a perfect life through solitude and menial jobs. The article also touches upon the idea that laws of physics are not absolute and can be violated under certain circumstances, such as reverse entropy concentration.

The article discusses the idea that the universe was created from a primal energy, with the details of how this happened being unanswered by modern science. It explores the philosophical ideas of Plato and Kant, as well as the concept of multidimensional reality in quantum physics, suggesting that reality is primarily made up of ideas or concepts before taking physical form.

The article discusses the concept of "downward constraints" in complex systems, which can result in power laws and other patterns observed in nature. The author cites various sources, including Stanley Salthe and Richard Mankiewicz, to support this idea. The article also provides examples of harmonographs, which demonstrate how simple rules can give rise to complex patterns.

In this article, the author explores the concept of creation and destruction in the cycle of existence. They suggest that the intention of creation favors constructive collaborations over destructive resistance, and that energy can be found in the cycle of existence. The article also references various scientific works on the topic of entropy and self-organized criticality.

The article discusses the idea that knowledge is impermanent and can be lost over time due to various factors such as destruction, obsolescence, or simply because it has not been recorded or preserved. The author suggests that humanity's tendency to forget or lose knowledge is statistically inevitable, and that at some point in the future, humans may be reduced to foraging barbarians again, as has happened in the past. The article also explores the concept of "knowledge" and how it evolves through stages of data, information, and understanding.

The article discusses a method for generating random numbers based on the positions of celestial bodies. The author uses the cross-summing technique to reduce millions of sampled data points to a single number, which is then used to demonstrate the linear progression of values. The resulting sequence of numbers appears random, but when cross-summed, all spatial or temporal information is lost, leaving only the pattern of the relationship between the numbers.
