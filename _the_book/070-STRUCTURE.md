Structure is the relationship between elements, so anything that relates to anything has a structure.  This is also true the conceptual structures of data, information, knowledge, and understanding, all of which are limited and defined by order, context and application and all of which are formed by relationships.  Structure is self-similar, therefore it hierarchical in nature.  All instances of a structure share the same fundamental properties of that structure.
