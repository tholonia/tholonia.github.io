title: Ch. 4 📜 The Laws
---

Each level of existence expresses the Universal laws according to the context and local laws it exists within.  If awareness is an expression of energy, then we should expect to see these laws in action, but in a different context.  Entropy is as much a philosophical concept as it is a physics concept as it is the law of balance.  We look at entropy from various perspectives and in relation to chaos, the 2<sup>nd</sup> law of Thermodynamics, inertia, pattern, and oscillation.  These are tied together in Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> law of motion which is deconstructed to a simple pattern, expanded upon, and re-applied to various contexts such as alchemy, electricity, and relativity.
