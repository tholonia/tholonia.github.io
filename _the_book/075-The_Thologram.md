title: Ch. 8 ðŸ“œ The Thologram
---

This chapter contains detailed explanations of how the thologram came into existence from nothingness and the structures of, and within, the thologram with real-world instances.  We explain and explore the thologram using geometry, math, colors, fractals, and numbers and apply some ancient and modern concepts to validate the redundancy of the thologram.
