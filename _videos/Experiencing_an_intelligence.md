This was a rare type of OOBE, one where I was placed in a role where I had no awareness of my other existence in the body.  "I" **was** this other... entity? expression? instance?... I'm not sure how to express it, but in that 'other' state, I was only and totally this 'other' consciousness and was only aware of this when I return to my body.  The question that remains is, was I experiencing some form of archetypal consciousness, or was this the consciousness from which my current existence emerged from?  I am leaning towards the later, as there were many symbolic and metaphorical parallels to my current reality.  Perhaps both are true, as each of us, and everything that exists, it an instance of some archetype(s).
