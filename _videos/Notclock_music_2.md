This is the synthesized music from the ['notclock' app](/gallery/notclock.html), which uses embedded MP3 data for the notes.  This was an attempt to create 'music' based on the tholonic algo.  I am not a musician and don't even play an instrument, so this is more of as proof-of-concept thing.  However, I have heard worse piano in beatnik bars and poetry slams.
