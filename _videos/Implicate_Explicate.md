Physicist David Bohm proposed the idea of implicate/explicate model as an alternative to the Uncertainty Principle. "He proposed that underlying physical appearances, the 'explicate order,' there is a deeper, hidden 'implicate order.' Applying this concept to the quantum realm, Bohm proposed that the implicate order is a field consisting of an infinite number of fluctuating *pilot* waves. The overlapping of these waves generates what appears to us as particles, which constitute the explicate order. Even space and time might be manifestations of a deeper, implicate order, according to Bohm." *(from SciAm)*. However, that same concept can be applied in the macro world we live in, as demonstrated by this video.
