  <p>The Tholonic model aims to integrate consciousness and technology by expanding our understanding of these concepts. This approach facilitates new perspectives compatible with the scientific method: 1) Observe, 2) Question, 3) Hypothesize, 4) Test, and 5) Measure.</p>
<p>The Tholonic model integrates both new and ancient theories of reality, with some minor adjustment here and there to bring them into a coherent alignment.</p>
