This simple form is the basis for all these instances, and you can see it is one line that divides into two lines, six times. Tholonically, the line, what you can actually see, are the relationships between one unsee-able 0-dimensional point that becomes two unsee-able 0-dimensional points, six times.

Static until mouse enters image. Mouse position defines angle of divergence and branch length.
