This SVG is, by far, the most ambitious of all these SVG projects.  It is an interactive tool to manipulate the basic 'tree' pattern and, despite its name, even has a 'tholonic clock' interface that displays time using the 'tree' algorithm, which, as has been stated many times, is the simplest of all possible patterns.
