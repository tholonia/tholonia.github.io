Applying the laws of energy to financial markets.  The goal is to create a trading bot based on these principles.
<!--more--> 

Modeling the financial market according to tholonic principles started out as a theoretical exercise and eventually because a practical exercise when we decided to create a tholonic trading bot. As one can imagine, applying theory to reality can be brutal to the theory, requiring the theory to adapt or die. This was the case here, but the adaptation had more to do with understanding how the theory was applied, not the theory itself, similar to the way it is very easy to describe the number 1, but what can be done with that to describe reality can get pretty complex. The clip below is showing one research phase of the project, where decisions are made based on signal analysis (FFTs, specifically) of various frequencies, as if the market ticker was an energy wave, such as sound. This project is only beginning, but it is on hold due to limitations of resources (mainly talent and time). 

p.s. This bot worked remarkably well, financially speaking.
