A pair of 3's is one of the most fundamental and universal patterns in existence, and we see it everyday, everywhere, in many different contexts.
<!--more--> 

Here are some examples of the 2x3=6 formula applied to different contexts, some well-known and some speculative. When referring to this pattern of 2x3=6 outside of the context of math, we call it "tholonic formula".

In the book [Tholonia](/the_book), the argument for applying these formulas to **Society** and **Psychology** are described and analyzed in more detail, with very positive results. The more speculative contexts are **Gravity** and **Consciousness**, and they may well be way off... the point it is to investigate.

The charts below shows this formulas applied to twelve different contexts, and it shows some interesting correlations.

For example, one of those context in the value of '**Pi(π)**, which is of particular interest with regard to the context of '**Tau (2π)**' and '**Pi(π)**'. 

There is a very legitimate and well-formed argument that π is the wrong number to use when using formulas that include 2π. Instead, Tau, **τ**, (which is 2π), should be used. The [Tau Manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto) explains this in detail. What is interesting here is that when we apply the tholonic formula to these two values, we see that, just as **τ** is double that of **π**, so too is **γ** and **α** doubled, but **β** is not as it must remain constant between the '**Tau (2π)**' and '**Pi(π)**' contexts. What is interesting about this is that **β** occupied the same positions as the constant **c**, the speed of light, in the context of energy ('**Joules**'), which, as you can see, includes the formula **E=mc2.** However, if we apply any significance to this, then why is **c** *not* in the same position in the '**Light**' context? Instead, that position is occupied by **w**, wavelength. The only reasoning I can come up with is that **c** is the constant for *all* light, but for a particular instance of light, it is **w** that is the constant. For example, a single frequency of green light with a frequency of 5.45x1014 Hz has a wavelength of 550nm only. If the wavelength were any different, it would not be that particular frequency of light. It's worth considering that ***c*** is only a constant by convention (see [VIDEO]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _videos/speed_of_light.md)) and not by 'reality'.

Another curiosity with '**Light**' is the **Power** value, which appears to be electron volts, but using a different measure, as this number is always and exactly 72.4802563497434 times the actual electron volt value.
