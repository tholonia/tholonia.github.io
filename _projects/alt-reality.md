Exploring, modeling, and testing other non-material realities.

<!--more--> 

The idea of other dimensions and realities has been around forever. It is axiomatic to the tholonic model that not only do these other realities exist, but they can be readily reached via various techniques such as OOBE (out-of-body experiences) and other techniques that allow consciousness to exist beyond the material. The phenomenon has been significantly documented in OOBE research and NDEs (near-death experiences), with convincing evidence. As someone who has had several OOBE experiences, the reality of these other dimensions can't be denied any more than the reality of this physical dimension. In fact, of all the various realities that exist, the physical reality appears to be one of the least "real".

Current mainstream science's lack of comprehension regarding nonphysical realities can be summed up in a quote from a Scientific American article titled "[What Near-Death Experiences Reveal about the Brain](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-near-death-experiences-reveal-about-the-brain/)":

>"Why the mind should experience the struggle to sustain its operations in the face of a loss of blood flow and oxygen as positive and blissful rather than as panic-inducing remains a mystery."

Here are some resources for the curious.

For tholonic purposes, we are interested in how energy moves and exists in these other realities, how intelligence instantiates, a how realities are formed by it.

Those who are adept at accessing these other realities often refer to a type of energy that is very similar to the Tholonic ideas of a 3rd 'spectrum' of energy more ethereal and potent than the material and electromagnetic states we are familiar with.  Once such concept, coined by the late OOBE explorer and researcher Robert Monroe, is that of "loosh". 

Here are a few videos (~30min @) from one such adept why goes openly by [Rick](https://www.youtube.com/@astralclub5964) explaining the concept.

The following two videos look at the crazy experiments and discoveries around the "Time Mirror", which is a mirror of energy, but not 'regular' energy, but the form of energy that, when warped, creates TIME... according to the Soviet and Russian scientist who created and tested this theory. You can read the book they wrote [here](/material/book_cosmic_cons_of_humanity.html).

Some people who have experienced an NDE also speak of this 'other' type of energy.  Here is just one example of such a testimonial

If you want to see what actual scientific experimentation looks like in this area, check out this 3 hour interview with  physicist Dr. Tom Campbell who is doing some fascinating research and experiments using OOBE techniques.
