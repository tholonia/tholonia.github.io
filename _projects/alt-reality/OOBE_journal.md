## OOBE Journal

At no point in my life did I question the existence of other realities, dimensions, and intelligences. This may be because I started having OOBEs about the same time I was learning to read. For those skeptical as to the 'reality' of OOBEs, the video on the right might be worth watching, or check out the book [The Projection of the Astral Body](/material/book_The_Projection_Of_The_Astral_Body_NOTFREE.html).

My experiences have spanned the spectrum from mind-blowingly awesome to terrifying. Each experience sheds light on the true mechanics of reality that begin far beyond our physical world and which we exist within. This perspective, along with being on the "spectrum", placed me firmly outside of mainstream reality, which is where the concept of Tholonia was born.

This page is a (somewhat censored) journal of my own OOBE experiences.
