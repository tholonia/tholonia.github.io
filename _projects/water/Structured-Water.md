Exploring the various attributes and types of water: Structured water, water memory, low-entropy water, water as an information store, and water as a tholonic medium.

<!--more--> 

## *Structured Water*

*(Most of this is from [Appendix J - Structured Water](/the_book/590-J-Structured_Water.html) in the book [THOLONIA](/the_book/))*

Given how water seems to be such an excellent tholonic medium, can we lower the entropy of water by increasing its order, adding structure in a way that matches and/or enhances the patterns of the thologram and see some differences in how it transmits or interacts with energy? If we notice any differences, we have another piece of potential evidence supporting the tholonic model.

As it happens, there is such a thing as *structured water*. *Coherent* or *Structured* water, for those who are not familiar with the term, is regular water that has been modified to give it more structure or pattern, specifically in the way that the water molecules are arranged in relation to one another, or so it is claimed.

OK, I know I probably lost some readers with this last sentence. If you do an Internet search of “structured water”, one of the top results you will get is the Wikipedia entry that begins with “structured water is a term used in a marketing scam”, and although that is true to the extent that anything can be a scam in the hands of scammers, the entry says nothing whatsoever on the legitimate research and testing that has been done regarding the use of structured water.

To the dogmatically skeptical, structured water is just more “swarming” of those heretically perverse “worms”. However, unless one suffers from a severe case of *scoleciheretiperviphobia* (fear of heretically perverse worms), they can easily find hundreds of papers, dozens of books, and scientific research from highly accredited pioneering professionals and leaders online [^1] supporting the structured water phenomena. Skepticism has its place and serves a critical purpose, but regarding the extreme skepticism of structured water, that purpose does not seem to be moving understanding forward or seeking new solutions to real-world problems, such as solving global water shortages and increasing crop production, as has been well documented by some of Australia’s largest produce farms.

To see the result of my own tests and how to make structured water, see  [Appendix J - Structured Water](/the_book/590-J-Structured_Water.html) in the book [THOLONIA](/the_book).

There is quite a lot of good research on the subject that we won’t detail here. However, we will look at Fabian Ptok’s Master’s thesis [Alternative Irrigation Methods: Structured Water in the context of a Growing Global Food Crisis due to Water Shortages](l/material_Alternative_Irrigation_Methods__Structured_Water_in_the_context_o.html) [^2] . He covers the subject well from an agricultural and food security perspective and provides several references to the research and work in this area. One of the often cited studies showed dramatic results in decreasing blood and DNA damage in diabetic rats, but this study is also criticized as it was small [^3]. There is also a book by Professor Gerald Pollack, who has an impressive list of credentials [^4] and is available online for free[^5]. I have not read this book, so this is not an endorsement or recommendation, however, some of his experiments and patents487 look very interesting. Dr. Pollack has made no claims about his work, but is raising funding to test his hypothesis that SW can have positive effect on health.

Another potentially trusted source is the work of Marcel Vogel (more on him later). He claimed that through years of work and thousands of experiments, he was able to prove that various forms of energy, including thought, could permanently change the spectrographic properties of water [^6]. He also claimed that water was an information storage system. This last claim is especially significant, considering Vogel was not only a chemical and physics researcher at IBM for 27 years, but he was an information medium specialist, holding patents on hard-drive memory technologies that are in use today.

<img alt='x' src='/projects/social/assets/116-water-ice.png' class='fr-w30p'>Water is an excellent test medium because the structure of molecular water is tetrahedral, and being the most basic shape of creation lends itself to many different tholonic applications. It’s worth noting that when it was originally suggested that water might be tetrahedral in shape back in 1938, the idea was met with disbelief. It was not until 80 years later, in 2013, that this was finally accepted as valid. Today…

> “It is widely accepted that liquid water structure is comprised of two closely interweaved components, i.e., tetrahedral and hexagonal structures”.[^7]

In fact, water, as ice, may be the closest instance of the entire tholonic structure of any other substance (that is common to us). *(image above from “Tetrahedrality is key to the uniqueness of water”)*^[^8]

The *silicate structures* of minerals are also quiet similar in that they are made up of tetrahedrons of various arrangements. The structure of water and quartz is so close that, in some conditions, ice has the same structure as quartz[^9]! While this was only discovered recently, the word “crystal” comes form the Greek word *krustallos*, meaning both *ice* and *rock crystal*, because the ancients believed quartz was permanently frozen water. This lends some credence to the metaphysical and ancient idea that water and quartz have a special relationship.

Radical ideas are often met with radical resistance. Structured water is one of those ideas, falling into the same New Age category as “crystal power”. Ignoring the 249D crystal that (possibly) created reality, common crystals have some pretty impressive qualities.

- Generate electricity (piezoelectric).
- Amplify, transmit, and store data (up to 300 million years [^10] - Generate signals (used in microchips, watches, internet routers and network controllers, satellites, up to billions of cycles per second).
- Control the transmission and phase of light (liquid crystal displays - LCDs)
- Ability to alter time (yes! They are called *time crystals*, representing a new state of matter, according to MIT.[^11])
- Ability to hold a magnetic charge.

Crystals can do all these amazing things because of the structure of the elements that make a crystal, and water, with its tetrahedral structure, is like a liquid crystal. As we have stated, energy creates order, and movement is the effect of energy. Therefore, adding energy via movement to a tetrahedral liquid, such as water, will positively or reinforce its structure. Being a more efficient conduit for transferring energy, that structure will likewise affect that which interacts with it by transferring more energy.

The hypothesis is that we should see measurable effects simply by causing movement to commercial water (tap or bottled).

In Ptok’s Master’s thesis mentioned above, the author examines various tests that grew different plants using tap water and structured water.

One of his findings was that structured water increased alfalfa growth by 15.1%. This may not sound like much, but in the U.S. alone, a 15% increase in alfalfa growth represents an additional 20,700,000 tons of alfalfa, which has a value of over 4 billion dollars. Similarly, some of Australia’s largest produce farms reported needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than traditional water[^12]. In the tholonic model, these examples also apply to concepts, intelligence, ideas, and of course, ideologies, be they scientific, spiritual, or political.

**Review of studies**

There have been several studies of SW using animals. One review does a meta-analysis of these studies, “*Structured Water: effects on animals*”. [^13]

> This review focuses on the effects of structured water on animals when it is consumed on a daily basis. Structured water is liquid water that is given altered H-bonding structure by treatment with various forms of energy including magnetic fields and light. While most of the research has been conducted on magnetized‘ water, which has structure of short duration, recent research has examined effects of a structured water with stability of at least 3.5 months.

**Conclusion**:

> The animal research conducted to date consistently demonstrated beneficial effects of SW consumption.

![img](/projects/social/assets/bullied_plant.png)There is another conclusion that also needs to be looked at, and that is the inability for some people, including scientists, to accept the possibility, or worse, attack not only any finding, but even the question as “worms of heretical perversity!”. It almost as if science is suffering from **sophophobia** (fear of learning), or worse, **rogophobia** (fear of asking questions).

An example of this is the very simple “experiment” produced by IKEA (yes, the furniture store), where they placed 2 identical plants side by side for 30 days in many K-12 GEMS schools (Global Education Management Systems[^14] across the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E). Signs near each plant instructed the viewer to either “compliment” the plant (right) or “bully” the plant (left). The short YouTube video[^15] had 1.2 million views, with 6,700 likes and 625 dislikes, and many of the comments were as vile as YouTube will allow. Granted, this exhibition will never get published in the *Journal for Experimental Science*, but it the clearest demonstration of the concept.

It is certainly sufficient to raise the question, “Do emotions effect life?” which sounds like a ridiculously silly question, as we all know the answer. Still, while there are countless studies on the effect of plants on human emotions, there is nary a one (that I can find) on the impact of human emotions on plants. This is unfortunate, as such a study would tell us a lot about the emotions/biology connection that presumably would have some effect on human’s often emotionally chaotic, fear-driven, culturally distorted minds. Unfortunately, the anger and dismissive attitudes expressed in the comments of this video are shared by many leaders in the scientific community, which can, at times, acts like a cult of scientism.
