I personally experienced similar results to those reviewed in the animal studies. In my own experiments I created SW simply by spinning 1 liter of water with a chemical stirrer in a magnetic field made of 6 equidistant and opposing magnets glued to the outside of the water jar, which was about 6 inches at its widest part. Each magnet (15mm x 3mm NbFeB 42 MGOe) has a strength 2335 *Gauss* at the closet point inside the jug, which drops to 3 *Gauss* at the center of the jar 3 inches from the magnet, and which drops to about 8 *Gauss* in-between the magnets (which are about 3.5 inches apart each. ) These are a bit weak, considering a magnetic field strength of 1000 to 3000 is required, but the *Gauss* drops below 1000 after 7 mm inside the jar. The water is spinning, so all the water is exposed to the stronger fields, but as it is constantly rotating, that exposure is temporary.

This was the only water I drank for close to a year, and neither my diet nor lifestyle changed in any significant manner during that time. The difference in the before and after blood tests were compatible with the tests on animals. My blood panel was generally better regarding cholesterol levels, but the most dramatic change was my triglycerides dropped from 750 to 150. This is anecdotal, but considering my results matched those of controlled tests on animals, it was enough for me to accept that structured water should at least be seriously studied.

Below are the tests I ran myself. Tests ***(j)*** and ***(k)*** were run numerous times with the same results. The results showed that the SW had an obvious effect in disintegrating the material faster and more thoroughly. This would suggest that the SW had a lower state of entropy/higher energy potential than the CW.

I suspect this is due to hydrogen bonds that have various lengths, directions, and strengths and can change and even break with kinetic energy and movement.

We know that the formation of hydrogen bonds in water can have large effects on the water’s entropy and that even small changes to water’s entropy can have a considerable influence[^5].

Hydrogen bonds in water are still a matter of debate in the scientific community.

What is not shown below are the tests I performed on mozzarella cheese, where sample X was placed in common water, and sample Y was placed in SW. Over the course of 2 weeks, X did not change at all and remained sitting at the bottom of the glass, while Y was floating after a few days and was quickly disintegrating and fermenting. This simple test alone would suggest that SW significantly affects the fermentation process, which could dramatically impact the 1.2 trillion dollar-per-year global beer and wine market.

### Making Structure Water

We look at three ways to create structured water.

Before we get into the techniques, there is an important point to make that is being made here because if you are reading this, you have obviously maintained both an open mind and a level of interest that is a prerequisite to the following topic. As we have mentioned, ideas have archetypes, and those archetypes have instances. One of the archetypes of Ideas is form. This would then suggest that ideas can alter archetypes of form, which can alter an instance of form. Tholonically speaking, that is exactly right. The mere thought of something has some effect on the instantiated form of that thought.

This is relevant to creating structured water or any creative process, but water seems to be a particularly sensitive medium. The thoughts you impose on the water have an effect on the water. While the scientific support for this claim is still being collected, evaluated, and debated, from a purely tholonic perspective, it is a valid hypothesis that focusing your awareness on water will have some effect. Also, in accordance with tholonic ideas, increasing the structure of water will create a better medium for interacting with, energetically.

**Manually**

Vortexing (whirlpooling) water by hand was shown to be effective in improving growth differences in plant tests, but it is not easily applied to larger-scale needs. It is fairly easy to create a vortex in a container of water, some small tubes and a water pump, or a chemical stirrer, which spins a magnet inside the water.

There also does not seem to be one standardized accepted technique to manually structuring water. One technique that seems to be popular is a homemade version of the same technique used in some of the industrial-sized units, and that is simply using marbles as a water filter. The reasoning behind using marbles is that the natural structure of water that is reinforced by its movement over and through the terrain, rivers, rocks, trees, etc., is destroyed by being processed, stored in stationary reserves, channeled through pipes, chemically modified, and a number of other modifiers. Simply flowing water over and through a marble filter causes the water to form many small eddies as it is constantly divided and reunited, allowing the water to return (closer) to its natural, more structured state.

People have reported favorable results by simply filling a tube with glass marbles, pouring water in one end, and collecting the water on the other end. The process can be repeated numerous times or placed inline to a water pump vortexer. If marbles work, then using the same reasoning, a sand filter would probably work even better. The [Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/safewater/pdf/sand_2011-final.pdf) has an entire page on sand filters.

Anything that forces water to reform itself is thought to have some effect. Some people say using quartz helps. Tholonically, this would make sense as we claim that structure is the result of order, order is the result of energy, energy has fields, and fields have induction.

Magnets have also been used. Although it may make sense that one could use magnets, no one seems to do a decent job of explaining how they work. The intuitive reasoning is simply that magnets are fields caused by order, therefore, magnetic fields can induce order. Some of Australia’s largest produce farms have been using magnetic water with phenomenal results, needing 25% less water to produce a superior product than with traditional water, according to Seven West Media, Western Australia’s leading news service.[^1]

Simple instructions can be found on the web[^2] for making a Hero’s Fountain (named after the first-century Greek mathematician Heron who discovered this process of an energy-free recycling water fountain) that recycles water through a loop. Fill one of the bottles with marbles or whatever you like, and when the cycle is complete, you have a bottle filled with restructured water.

**Commercial Attachments**

Devices such as the Martin-Wasserwirbler (MW) attachment are small devices that claim to restructure water, typically by creating a vortex within the device. The Martin-Wasserwirbler (developed in Germany) is an attachment that forces the water through a series of vortex-creating channels made of oppositely charged metals. I am slightly suspicious of this last bit as they say they use silver and gold as the oppositely charged metals, but both of these metals have similar ionization and electronegativity properties, so unless they are doing something to these metals to change that, it’s not clear how they can be oppositely charged. This is not to say they are not, just that it is unclear.

The MW device was the first device to create structured water and was based on the ideas originally conceived by the brilliant Viktor Schauberger, the Austrian forest caretaker, naturalist, parascientist, philosopher, inventor, and biomimicry experimenter, and his son Walter Schauberger, both of whom studied the qualities of water.[^3]

The idea that the qualities of water lost due to its processing could be reintroduced by creating a vortex within the water was originally brought up in 1972 in a conversation with civil engineer Wilhelm Martin, who was working on ways to improve tap water. In 1997 Martin published his paper “Experimente mit Leitungswasser” Experiments with Tap Water[^4]. In that paper, he describes the Martin-Wasserwirbler (Martin Water Vortex, MWV) and his 30 years of experimentation with the concept.

Tests with the MWV have shown positive results, such as a rise in pH, oxygen content, and a decline in water temperature. Unfortunately, no tools exist to measure many of the qualities of water that we believe are its most important, which is the manner water moves, stores, and transmits energy, including the energy of awareness.

**Industrial Solutions**

Pursanova is a company that makes complete water processing systems for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Their products range from $20 to many thousands. They have a number of case studies on their website (pursanova.com), which are astounding.

*Disclaimer: I have no relationship with any of these companies and am not promoting any of their products. I refer to them simply because my research seems to indicate they are legitimate products in an industry filled with wild and dubious claims.*
