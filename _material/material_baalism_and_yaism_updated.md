"Worship, in the biblical sources and in liturgical history, is not something a person experiences, it is something he does, regardless of how he feels about it, or whether he feels anything about it at all... Baalism provided a rich array of 'worship experiences.' Israel and the Christian church insisted that worship was the proclamation of the will of God and the call for human response to it."
