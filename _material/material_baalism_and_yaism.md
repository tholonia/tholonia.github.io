Baal was the god of the the Canaanites and their orgiastic nature-worship, their cult of fertility in the form of serpent symbols and sensuous nudity, and their gross mythology.  Yahweh was the god of Israel, with its pastoral simplicity and purity of life, its lofty monotheism, and its severe code of ethics.  These diametrically oppose ideologies lived together in the Levant, and consequently, they began to merge.  This is a good example of the competition/cooperation between ideological 'entities'.
