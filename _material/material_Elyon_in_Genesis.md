Elyon is the name of god referred to in the Old Testament (and other ancient manuscripts), but Elyon is not the same as Yahweh, as is thought to be a Canaanite god, yet, nevertheless found it's way into the extremely anti-Canaanite Torah.  This is an example of how opposing concepts of god (Yahweh vs Baal, Israel vs Canaanite) overlapped, inevitable forming a new concept of god, which many adhere to today.
