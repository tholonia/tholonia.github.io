title: Decoding the Neural Representation of Story Meanings across Languages
---

The article discusses a study on the neural correlates of narrative comprehension using fMRI. The researchers used a sliding window approach to predict each word in a paragraph based on its context, and learned paragraph vectors that represented the higher-level meaning of the text. They found that different brain regions were involved in narrative comprehension, including the temporal lobe, and intersubject correlations were observed in the narrative speech comprehension. The study used permutation inference to validate the results and evaluated the predictions using a similar approach to Mitchell et al. [2008].
