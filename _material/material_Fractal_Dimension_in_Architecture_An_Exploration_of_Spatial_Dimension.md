title: Fractal Dimension in Architecture - An Exploration of Spatial Dimension
---

"Mandelbrot (1975) coined the term, Fractal to define natural forms and the hidden but simple code behind their seemingly complex appearance. Fractal dimension, the rudiment of fractals, usually described as space filling property, provides a foundation for analyzing roughness of surfaces. However, roughness exists in all dimensions. Architecture, innately related to geometry/forms, shows roughness at many scales from urban fabric to a building's facades and plans." This is the Master Thesis of Kris Gurung of Anhalt University of Applied Sciences, Anhalt, Germany
