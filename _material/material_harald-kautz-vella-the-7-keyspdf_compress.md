"The seven Trojan Horses, which gained access to our human culture and directed our development, cannot be exposed and dissembled one by one. They are interwoven, in other words, they stabilize each other. In essence, they are what we perceived as the solutions, and thus as being constructive. To this intent, within the course of the following chapters, I wish to present to you the complete list in chronological order in a manner that enables you to understand the overall concept, unmask this darkness camouflaged in light in one piece, and exit by letting go of it."
