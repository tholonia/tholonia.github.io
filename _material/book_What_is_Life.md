Based on Schrödinger's lecture focused on one question: "how can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?" and hypothesizes an "aperiodic crystal" that contained genetic information which was instrumental in discovering the genetic molecule. Forward by  Roger Penrose.
