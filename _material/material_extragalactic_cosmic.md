---

Recent work has revealed a 62 million-year cycle in fossil diversity in the past 542 million years, but for reasons unknown. This paper suggests that the cycle may be caused by cosmic-ray and the solar system's 64 million-year galactic vertical oscillation.  This shows a fascinating relationship between galactic events and our current understanding of the based on fossils.
