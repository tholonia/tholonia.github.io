Brownian motion applies across any context or pattern that can be analysed statistically but may not be predicted precisely, which includes pretty much everything.  Brownian expansion is fundamental to tholonic expansion.  This math shown here (quite dense) should act as a guide for calculating the rules of tholonic expansion.
