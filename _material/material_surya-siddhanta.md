The (allegedly) 2 million year old manual of astronomical facts that the Sun  god **Surya** gave to the demon **Maya**.  This includes the roots of trigonometry,  mathematical inventions, such as standard notation and the decimal system. The description  gravity,  sidereal revolutions and how planets move eastward, size and size and position of distant planets, the duration of a tropical year and the amount of time that has passed since the creation of the Universe, and the relativism of time in how passes at different speeds and under different circumstances. More importantly, from the Tholonic perspective, it describes a classic example of the sharing of Intelligence between two archetypal instances of Awareness.
