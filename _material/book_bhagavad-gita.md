While the Tholonic Model gives religion and religious beliefs a wide berth, some religious doctrines and writings are, or include, metaphysical or esoteric laws that are draped in religious or spiritual symbolism, from cause and effect to biogenesis.

The Taoist Tao Te Ching and I Ching is one example where intricate and complex mathematical truths exist beneath the moral and cultural context of the day.   The Bhagavad Gita is another, wherein the *gunas* are described as the forces of duality that compose the universe of mind and matter and are the origin of any experiences bound by physicality.  Much of the Gita is just generally good advice, such as...



"thinking about sense-objects will attach you to sense-objects; grow attached, and you become addicted; thwart your addiction, it turns to anger; be angry, and you confuse your mind; confuse your mind, you forget the lesson of experience; forget experience, you lose discrimination; lose discrimination and you miss life's only purpose" 

While this may not be a "provable" statement (although it may well be), it certainly qualifies and is a truth we can accept without proof, i.e., addicts of any kind tend to have less clarity of thought and a more frustrating life.

May concepts in the Gita are quite compatible with tholonic concepts and can shed light on them from a different perspective, thereby increasing understanding of those concepts. 

That is why this book is included here.
