“The most significant scientific discovery of this century. What strikes me
above all is the elegant simplicity of [Pollack’s] experimental approach.
Many of the experiments can be done on the kitchen table, and you don’t
even need a microscope to see the results.” *Mae-Wan Ho, Author, Living
Rainbow H<sup>2</sup>O; Director, Institute of Science and Society, London.*
