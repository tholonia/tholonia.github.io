"A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features."

This paper discusses the concept of intelligence and its various definitions. It highlights that being able to deal with difficult problems is a matter of experience, rather than just intelligence. Intelligence is defined as the ability to use limited resources optimally to achieve goals in a range of environments.
