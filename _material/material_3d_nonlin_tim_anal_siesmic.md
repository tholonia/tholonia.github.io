I can't remember how this document was used or why it was even saved, but it was probably related to the stability of geometrical structures in a real world setting, such as the earth, earthquakes, and foundations.

Keywords: finite elements; microplane model; contact mechanics; time history analysis; soil structure interaction; site-effects; seismic performance assessment.
