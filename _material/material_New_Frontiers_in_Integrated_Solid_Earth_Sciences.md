Examines the dynamics of sedimentary basins and their relationship with tectonic processes. It presents various examples of how different basins have responded to changes in tectonic forces over time, including the formation of microdiamonds in the Earth's crust. The article highlights the importance of understanding these dynamics to better predict future geological events and their impact on the environment.

{% comment %}This book series is one of the many important results of the International Year of Planet Earth (IYPE), a joint initiative of UNESCO and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), launched with the aim of ensuring greater and more effective use by society of the knowledge and skills provided by the Earth Sciences.  {% endcomment %}

<!--more--> 

This book is good perspective on where mainstream thinking is directed regarding the state of the earth, and is supported by the efforts of:

- International Year of Planet Earth (IYPE) 
- International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) 
- Earth Science Division of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
- International Geoscience Programme (IGCP)

It added here because it is these groups and other large, well funded and supported organizations that greatly determine our awareness of current issues.
