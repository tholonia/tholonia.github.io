This paper is an elementary-level attempt at discussing 8D E8 Physics based on the 240 Root Vectors of an E8 lattice and how it compares with physics models based on 4D and 3D structures.  Also included are some amazing laser sculptures in 3D glass cubes, including a sculpture of the 240 E8 Root Vectors and different 2D face projections of 3D cube projection from full 8D Root Vectors, which are all different perspectives of the same multidimensional hyper-crystal.  This hyper-crystal is fundamental to the popular "Theory of Everything".
