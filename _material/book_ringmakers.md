title: Ringmakers of Saturn by Norman R. Bergrun
---

From photographs taken during the Voyager 1 flight to SATURN in 1980 the reader of this remarkable book sees that one of the photographs shows that the A-ring is incomplete. The author sets out to explain this phenomenon in an understandable form.

The famous Cassini and Enke gaps also fit into the author's explanation. The micro photography employed by the Author answers many of the questions about Saturn asked since Galileo and the Author further shows a relation to the well defined crater on the earth's moon called 'Mare Orientale' and to the 1908 Tunguska catastrophe in the U.S.S.R.

While ChatGPT says this book is a fringe conspiracy theory, it's worth noting that the author, Norman R. Bergrum, was a scientist who worked at Ames Research Labs, NASA, and Lockheed Martin, and pioneered the methodology of thermal ice prevention design, roll-stability laws for airplanes and missiles, manager of test planning and analysis for the Polaris Underwater Launch Missile System, evaluated satellite system applications, was a director of Information Systems, founded his own company in 1971 and is cited in "Who's Who in the World" and other reference works.
