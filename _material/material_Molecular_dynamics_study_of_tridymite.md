Tridymite is a high-temperature polymorph of silica (SiO<sup>2</sup>).  It is of interest here as it crystalline form is that of the thologram.  This is quite similar to quartz (SiO<sup>4</sup>) chemically, and to water, structurally. In fact, quartz and (very cold) ice has a nearly identical structure.
