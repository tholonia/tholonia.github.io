title: Intelligence as Smart Heuristics
---

"Human intelligence, in our view, is modeled by an adaptive toolbox that contains building blocks for heuristics to direct search for information, to stop search, and to make a decision. Smart search rules describe how people find the few relevant pieces of information, in memory or in the outside world"

<!--more-->

Llama2 summary:

The concept of "Take The Best" is a heuristic used in decision-making where individuals rely on the first piece of information that favors one option over the other, ignoring subsequent information. The heuristic is effective in some situations but can fail in others, particularly when the information available is not relevant to the decision at hand. Examples of domain-specific heuristics and their limitations are provided.
