Discusses the relationship between brain structural complexity and consciousness. It suggests that the brain's structure undergoes changes during the sleep-wake cycle, with an increase in neuronal connections during wakefulness and a decrease after sleep, resulting in opposite changes in structural diversity. The study highlights the importance of sleep in maintaining brain homeostasis and optimizing functionality.

{% comment %}Structure shapes function. Understanding what is structurally special about the brain that allows it to generate consciousness remains a fundamental scientific challenge. Recently, advances in brain imaging techniques have made it possible to measure the structure of human brain, from the morphology of neurons and neuronal connections to the gross anatomy of brain regions.{% endcomment %}
