In the tholonic model, Newtons 2<sup>nd</sup> law is use across many contexts.  Many physicists and engineers will argue that Ohm's law and Newton's 2<sup>nd</sup> law of motion are totally unrelated, and even ChatGPT makes that same claim.  However, this paper shows exactly how, with hard math, these two laws relate to one another.
