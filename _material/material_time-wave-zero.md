This is Terence McKenna's most important idea, according to him.  "Time Wave Zero" is a theory that suggests that the fractal convergence that occurs at the end of the current "time wave" occurred on December 21, 2012. McKenna believed that this date marks the culmination of a global information network and the evolution of cybernetic technology, which will allow humanity to transcend its current state and reach a higher level of existence. McKenna draws on various cultural and historical references to support his theory.
