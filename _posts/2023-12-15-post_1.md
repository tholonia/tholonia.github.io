After months, no... years of trying to get everything organized enough to put on a website, this site is where that is at, which doesn't look like much given there is almost nothing it, for now. This was the latest in a string of failed attempts that wasted way too much time and money. This site, besides being awesome (architecturally speaking), is totally FREE, thanks to the unfathomably brilliant and inspiring people at GitHub and the Opensource community. It still blows my mind that millions of hours of absolutely brilliant work and technology are 90% at my disposal for free with no strings attached. Well, there is one rather large string with some nasty hooks on it, and that is you have to learn how to use the resources available, and that can be daunting at times, especially when you begin to feel like a certified moron because you can't anything to work... and that's way consultants charge \$400/hr!  I may have to buy my coffee on layaway, but the money I haven't had to pay a consultant because poverty forced me to learn it myself could easily buy a mansion :/
