title: Frequencies - Broaden, not Raise.
---

The concept, or metaphor, of 'frequencies' to refer to one's state of consciousness or level of spiritual attainment, is severely misleading, and inevitably results in the opposite of our intentions.

I want to talk about something that I find really not just annoying, but I think it is even detrimental. I know this might be a bit on the spectrum for a lot of people because it's going to sound like an insignificant, unimportant, minor little, nitpicky detail. Still, I think it plants a seed in the mind that is not just inaccurate but actually, a liability, and that is the idea when people talk about the evolution of consciousness, spirituality, or certain kinds of psychological perspectives, that sort of thing, often they refer to frequency and how they need to raise their frequency or techniques to raise one's frequency. This is not just a silly idea... it's completely wrong. When you just think about the application of frequencies,  at what point in what application is a higher frequency better than any other frequency? I understand that the idea of frequency is a metaphor, but a metaphor is supposed to compare two things to show their likeness, and that is absolutely not the case when we're talking about spiritual or consciousness evolution. How is a high-frequency tone more evolved than a low-frequency tone, metaphorically or otherwise,  besides the obvious that one is not better than the other? If anything, the lower frequency is a lot more tolerable than the higher frequency, not unlike the equally intolerable people who think they are a higher frequency than people they deem to be 'lower' frequencies.

The bigger problem with the concept of frequency is it's a one-dimensional description of a multi-dimensional state of being in a multi-dimensional universe. A better example of the shortcomings of frequency is if we were to look at a picture through a low-frequency filter, like red, or a high-frequency filter, like blue. We'd only be seeing a small portion of the picture, and the better the filter, the less information we'd see.

If we think in terms of high-frequency being better than low-frequency, we are actually confusing and deceiving ourselves into believing that this smaller perspective is in some way significantly more important or more evolved than the other colors/frequencies.

The more metaphorically correct example, if we're going to use this metaphor, is to start out looking at the low frequencies, starting at the bottom, and rather than looking at just the higher frequencies,  incorporating higher and higher frequencies into the picture until you can see the entire spectrum of colors, and a much more holistic and complete image.

So, how does that apply the metaphor of frequencies regarding consciousness, evolution, and spirituality? You need to incorporate both high and low 'frequencies'. It's not about going higher. This is a very Western concept; that it must be higher, bigger, faster, stronger. The more effective approach is to broaden your perspective. You need to go into the mud as well as into the stars. Going only into the stars is as useless as just going into the mud. You obviously need both. You need the sky, you need the Earth. 

The problem is people who are floating around only in the stars think that they are making progress when, in fact, they're not. They're actually hindering progress and may even have double the work to do because they're going to have to go all the way back to their low frequencies.  

Carl Jung addressed a similar concept when he talked about having to embrace your dark side. If we're talking about spiritual consciousness, concepts the Jungian model of the dark side are perfect because we tend to think of teh dark side as the lower frequencies, the more violent, the more reactionary, the more negative emotions like greed or jealousy, envy, or an imbalanced attention on service-to-self versus service-to-others. These would be qualities of the dark side. 

The key point here is imbalanced attention because you need to take care of yourself and others in your community or society, which you must exist in. Even if we live alone in the woods, we live in an integrated environment with trees, plants, rivers, sky, and whatever. No matter where we exist, we are integrated into the environment. If we are disintegrated in that environment, we will not flourish, and our material presence might come to an end. That's kind of what Extinction is. So, if you are on a path of evolving your consciousness, this model is probably going to serve you much better than just the idea of raising your frequency. 

From a tholonic perspective, it's also much more practical because the bigger the difference between the two points that represent the two extremes of any instance, any context, any scope, there's going to be a high and a low, a minimum and a maximum. Whatever it happens to be, there are going to be limits to a system: the lower limit and the higher limit,  however we measure it. The wider those limits, the bigger the difference between them, and the larger the field of expression. If you are purely a high-frequency person, you have an extremely narrow band to create new experiences in your reality and your world, whether it's a low low band, a high band, or a middle band; it doesn't matter.

If you have a narrow band, you have narrow opportunity. The wider the band, the wider the opportunity. That's similar to the definition of what voltage (also known as 'potential') is. The 'potential' is the difference between the high and the low; the bigger the potential, the more voltage. The more voltage, the more energy, the more energy, the more ability to use that in whatever creative ways you want to. 

What this means in a practical day-to-day sense, in actual reality, and in a physiological sense as well, is recognizing the reptilian part of your being, the dark, 'evil', and ferocious part, as well as the divine, spiritual, and angelic part. If you can recognize both sides of the spectrum you exist within, you will have a clearer understanding of a more holistic, broader, multi-dimensional reality and yourself. Consequently, your relationship to/with reality changes (for the better, in case that needs to be said).
