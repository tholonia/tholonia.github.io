title: Ancient Technical Knowledge
---

The Surya Siddhanta is an ancient cosmological technical manual revised around 800 CE. Still, it claims to have been sourced 2 million years earlier (at the end of Satya Yuga) by Surya, the Hindu Sun God. Regardless of when it was written, it predates modern Western knowledge by at least 1000 years.

Here's a 5 minute video that highlights some of its impressive claims

- *The Surya Siddhanta is an incredible testimony to the advanced thinking of the ancient Indians. In this text, one can find the roots of trigonometry, as well as essential mathematical inventions, such as standard notation and the decimal system. In addition, the text describes gravity for a millennium before Sir Isaac Newton developed his theory in 1687. He explains the sidereal revolutions and how planets move eastward. Accurately calculate the size and position of distant planets, the duration of a tropical year and the amount of time that has passed since its creation. Finally, in his discussion about how time passes at different speeds and under different circumstances, it contains the seeds of relativity.*

From a tholonic perspective, what is most relevant is that it describes a transference of Intelligence between the Sun, planets, and the Cosmos in general, which, via the Intelligence of the Sun, is imparted to Man. This is an excellent example of how Intelligence exists and functions and how our own Intelligence can "learn" from what we consider to be inanimate and unintelligent objects, like planets, stars, plants, and our environment.

I selected the Surya Siddhanta simply because it was short and packed with fascinating data, but this is also true of many ancient documents.  

A [brief overview](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/advanced-scientific-knowledge-ancient-indian-look-sanjay-k-mohindroo-/) of some of the topics the ancients knew of can be seen on the LinkedIn.com page of a CIO-techy-digital dude named "Sanjay K Mohindroo", who has posted hundreds of articles on LinkedIn, of all places.

[All his articles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjaykmohindroo/recent-activity/articles/) are interesting and worth checking out. 

One of the more debated claims is that the [Rig Veda calculates the speed of light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPly2N00cBE), as briefly shown in the image below. I certainly can't say whether this is accurate or true, but the fact that they understood light has a speed at all is impressive, considering Western science didn't discover this fact until  [Ole Rømer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_R%C3%B8mer) first [demonstrated this 1676](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8mer%27s_determination_of_the_speed_of_light).

One of the more realistic and slightly comic quotes from the book is the initial meeting of the Sun and Maya, the student:

- *Some time before the end of the Krita Yuga, a great Demon named Maya, desirous of obtaining the sound, secret, excellent, sacred, and complete knowledge of Astronomy, which is the best of the six sciences subordinate to the Vedam, practiced the most difficult practice: the worship of the Sun.*

  *The self-delighted Sun, gratified at Maya's such (difficult) penance, bestowed on him the knowledge of the science of Astronomy, which he inquired after.*

  *The illustrious Sun said: "(O Maya), I am informed of your intention and pleased with your penance. I, therefore, grant you the great knowledge of astronomy. But since nobody can bear my light and I have no time to teach you, this man, who partakes of my nature, will impart the whole of the science to you."*

  *The God Sun, having thus spoken, ordered the man born from himself (to teach Maya) and disappeared.*

The fact that Maya was a demon did not deter the Sun from imparting his knowledge. All that mattered to the Sun was that Maya was a dedicated follower. Whether this was anthropomorphized or not does not matter, as it shows that the energy of Intelligence moves only in the direction that is in its best interest, i.e., the path of least resistance. 

This law applies to Awareness and consciousness just as it does to Intelligence, which has profound consequences and implications regarding the direction and evolution of consciousness.
