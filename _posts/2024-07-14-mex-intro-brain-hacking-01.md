This describes a unique technique to access parts of your brain that are connected to many, many different realities, intelligences, consciousnesses, and stuff I don't even know how to describe,  while remaining highly alert and interactive with your physical environment.  It's a technique that allows your to hold multiple states of consciousness simultaneously by widening the spectrum of consciousness beyond the narrow band we typically operate in by using the abilities your were born with but never knew you had. IMPORTANT: It requires practice, patience, and a stable psychological profile.  If you do not check all three, it's not for you.
