title: More Water Material
---

I just added two new papers on water to the [Material](/material) section, from  Masaru Emoto (et al.)
[Healing with Water]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _material/material_healing-with-water.md %}) and [Effects of Distant Intention on Water]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _material/material_effects-of-distant-intention-on-water.md %}).

Honestly, I am not the biggest fan of his research as he leaves too many holes open and details left out.  Nevertheless, I think what he is doing is very significant.
