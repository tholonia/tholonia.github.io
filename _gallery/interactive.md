These interactive SVG animations are based on the same concept illustrated in the [Tholonic Coloring Book](/gallery/tholonic_coloring_book.html) and [NotClock](/gallery/notclock.html).  An SVG  file (**Scalable Vector Graphics**) is a standard graphics file used for rendering two-dimensional images over the web.  However, SVG files can also contain JavaScript code, which means an entire JavaScript application can exist with an image file.  These SVGs here are some I built to experiment with that possibility.

Some of these (where you see a :green_circle:) recognize a series of keyboard commands, shown here:
![hotkeys](/interactive/assets/img/instructions.png)

These are all 'sketchbook' quality, meaning they are built for experimenting and for fun, so some may perform poorly and have obvious bugs.
