<b>These are the video created by the Tholonia Project and are in some way related to the tholonic concepts.  As such, many deal with what is currently seen as metaphysical or esoteric subjects.  We categorize them this way because science has not yet expanded its thinking to include parts of reality that are just as real, if not more so, that this material spectrum we place most of our attention on.  Science will eventually get there, and we can see early signs of this in the more bleeding edges of theory that require concepts of a multiverse, morphic fields, and consciousness-as-a-force to explain reality.</b>
