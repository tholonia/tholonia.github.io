These animations are composed of 360 individual frames, with each frame representing 1 degree of rotation around a circle.  These are 6-generation fractals, where one point splits into two points 6 times.  The movement is caused by a small change in detail (angle, length color, etc.) in the first parent point/line, which is then passed down to all the children one generation at a time.  In some cases, the children act identically to the parent, and in other cases, some children act differently.

The tholonic fractals are simple 2-dimensional fractals, unlike the Mandelbrot fractals that are 2+ dimensions, and involve imaginary numbers.  The transforms here, when applied to the Mandelbrot "bug", look like video below.
